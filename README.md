# LiA-algorithm v. 1.0
LiA called by **Lightning Aproximatte algorithm** is an optimization algorithm inspired by nature phenomenon knows as lightning.

* LiA is programmed in Python using numpy, scipy and pandas

* __.txt files__ show the results obtained during the tests. 

* Files with __.py__ extension contain the code developed to present this novel algorithm based on evolutionary computation conceps for using to global optimization problems.

* LiA has been evaluated with 12 well-known optimization functions in this test version. These functions are unimodals and multimodals. 

* Finally, Lia has been compared with 3 swarm algorithms such as PSO (Particle swarm optimization), FWA (Fireworks algorithm) 
and ABC (Artificial bee colony optimization).

Final results are shown in __.txt files__ to visualize the performace to compare with swarm algorithms.
