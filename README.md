# LiA-algorithm
LiA is an optimization algorithm inspired in nature phenomenon knows as lightning.

LiA is programmed in Python and I have shared the .txt files with the results obtained during the tests. 
The final 7 files in this repository are the .py files with the code developed in order to present this novel 
colective intelligence algorithm applied to global optimization problems.

LiA has been evaluated with 12 wel-known optimization functions. These functions are unimodals and multimodals. 
Finally, Lia has been compared with 3 swarm algorithms such as PSO (Particle swarm optimization), FWA (Fireworks algorithm) 
and ABC (Artificial bee colony optimization).
These results are shown in .txt files and one script to visualize the performace of each algorithm.
