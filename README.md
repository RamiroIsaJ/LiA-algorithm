# LiA-algorithm
LiA is an optimization algorithm inspired in nature phenomenon knows as lightning.

LiA is programmed in Python and I have shared the .txt files with the results obtained during the tests. 
The final 7 files in this repository are the .py files with the code developed in order to present this novel 
colective intelligence algorithm applied to global optimization problems.
